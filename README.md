# measurespv
A project aimed at measuring the activity level of SPV wallets in the Bitcoin network

__Goals__
* accurately measure the use of SPV wallet in the network
* calculate the percent of transactions on the network that involve SPV wallets

__Why Does It Matter__
* Bitcoin prides itself on being a decentralized network, but the vast majority of users do not run a full node. Instead, they opt for lightweight wallets
    * This leads to more centralization in the network
    * Lightweight wallets might have privacy issues unknown to users

* Understanding the patterns and habits of the most used wallet type on the network is key to understanding the health of the network
    * Gauging the health of the network is of high importance for a multi-billion dollar market
    * Previous attempts at gauging health are focused on miners and full nodes, little is done to estimate use of SPVs, despite them being the majority in the network

__Progress__
* Still in the reasearch phases
