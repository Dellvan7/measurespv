# measurespv
A project aimed at measuring the activity level of SPV wallets in the Bitcoin network

__Goals__
* accurately measure the use of SPV wallet in the network
* calculate the percent of transactions on the network that involve SPV wallets

__Why Does It Matter__
* Bitcoin prides itself on being a decentralized network, but the vast majority of users do not run a full node. Instead, they opt for lightweight wallets.
* Understanding the patterns and habits of the most used wallet type on the network is key to understanding the health of the network

__Progress__
* Still in the reasearch phases
